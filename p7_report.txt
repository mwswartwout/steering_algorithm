For this project I used the code that Dr. Newman provided for the linear steering controller, and combined that with the pub_des_state nodes we had previously written. This video shows the mobot taking the same path that Jinx will take to go to the vending machine. I experimented with different gain settings, but found that the provided defaults provided perfectly acceptable performance.
